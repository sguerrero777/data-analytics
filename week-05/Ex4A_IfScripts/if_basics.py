# Define the Following Variables

x = 100
y = 20

# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Express each of the following statements using an if block. Notice that each block 
# uses the updated value of x set by the previous block: 

# 3a) If x divided by y is 5, print “x divided by y is 5” and set the value of x to 1 – otherwise 
#     print “are the variables set up correctly?” 

if x / y == 5:
    print('x divided by y is 5')
    x = 1
else:
    print('Are the variables set up correctly?')

# Output: x divided by y is 5

# 3b) If x times y is y, print “now x times y is y” and then set x to 10 – otherwise print 
#     “Whoops, x equals” + the value of x 

if x * y == y:
    print('now x times y is y')
    x = 10
else:
    print(f'Whoops, x equals {x}')

# Output: now x times y is y

# 3c) If x is less than y, print “x is less than y” and double the value of x – otherwise print 
#    “uh oh, x is not less than y” 

if x < y:
    print('x is less than y')
    x = x * 2
else:
    print("uh oh, x is not less than y")

# Output: x is less than y

# 3d) If x is greater than y, print “how is x greater than y??” otherwise print “x is NOT 
#     greater than y” 

if x > y:
    print("How is x greater than y??")
else:
    print('x is NOT greater than y')

# Output: x is NOT greater than y

# 3e) Add a final print statement to say “The final value of x is __ and the final value of y 
#    is __” (displaying the actual values in place of the blanks)

print(f"The final value of x is {x} and the final value of y is {y}.")

# Output: The final value of x is 20 and the final value of y is 20.
